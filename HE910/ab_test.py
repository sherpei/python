"""
ab_test.py
Feb 2012|corrected and tested for Python 2.7.2 on HE910
- added coding line on top
- modified file path to /sys folder
Jan 2009|copyright added, checked & tested
30/05/2008|Sgo|lt|1st ver
The script tries to open the test.bin file. If the file already exists, the program appends
some data, otherwise a new file is created with wb parameter.
