testStrArg.py
Feb 2012|corrected and tested for Python 2.7.2 on HE910
- added coding line on top

The script is to test the string allocation. It seems that no space is allocated
in the names list for the strings delimited by '' AND ending with \r.
removeCRfrom(string) is a function to use the string without \r
"""
#import MDM

#the following variables are not used in the code but loaded in the name space only if not terminated with \r
a='ATE1\r'
b="AT+GMR\r"
d='ATE1'

#the following variables are used in the code but loaded in the name space only if not terminated with \r
e='good'
f='good2\r'
g="best"
h="best2\r"
